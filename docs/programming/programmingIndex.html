    <h3>The Evolution of Web Development</h3>

    <p>Web development has faced several evolutions over time, which is in fact very common with any branch of technology, going through several paradigms, languages and practices more common in the market.</p>

    <h3 id="client-server-model">Client / Server Model</h3>

    <p >The client and server model can be understood as a model for software, where a service is provided to its client, the same computer can act as both client and server<b>[Cite Client and Server article in networking section]</b> at the same time, since this situation does not concern the machine, but rather the behavior of a specific software.</p>

  <div id="div-paradigms">
        
    <h3 id="paradigms">Paradigms</h3>

    <h4 id="static-pages">Static Pages</h4>

    <p>One of the first paradigms of web development, where the pages were totally static, as the name implies, and any change in the site would require changing its "source-code", so to speak.</p>

    <img src="/images/staticpages.png" alt="Static Pages Visualization">

    <h4 id="dynamic-pages">Dynamic Pages</h4> 

    <p>A paradigm evolution was the dynamic generation of pages, where it is no longer necessary to keep changing the "source-code" for each new information that we want to change or even remove, now these files are generated by a code block running on the server, when the client sends a request to the server.</p>

    <img src="/images/dynamicpages1.png" alt="Dynamic Pages Visualization">

    <p>With the evolution of the technologies used in both Front-End and Back-End development, the methodology of generating structured files and sending them to the client was adopted, making it the responsibility of the Web Browser to transform the files sent into an actual Web Page, thus saving computational resources.</p>

    <p>Generating client-side HTML code using only Javascript tends to be laborious and give rise to much repeated code, with this comes the advent of Frameworks, which facilitate this work, such as Angular, React, Vue and so many others.</p>

    <p>Many formats for these structured files sent to the client have been used, like the obsolete XML, which has been replaced by JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), given the large use of JavaScript in both environments.</p>

    <img src="/images/dynamicpages2.png" alt="Dynamic Pages Visualization">

    <h4 id="full-stack">Full Stack</h4>

    <p>The Full Stack Paradigm aims to integrate tools, methods, and practices so that it becomes possible to generate a web application, not only to deliver pages, either statically generated or Just In Time (JIT)<b>[Cite JIT article in Programming section]</b>.</p>

    <img src="/images/fullstack.png" alt="Full Stack Visualization">

    <p>In the example the stack used was MEAN, uniting MongoDB as a Non-Relational Database<b>[Cite Non-Relational Database article in Database section]</b>, Express and Angular as frameworks and Javascript as the programming language. </p>

    <p>There are several other stacks that can be used, that mix the most diverse market options, see a little more in the image below.</p>
